This project is a webstie with 3 tabs. Each tab has a different function. The website is as shown in the picture below.
The project was to make a website where the user can access and edit the database.
The database also included PDF files which is accessed by clicking on the scheme number yielded by the search, if any.
At the time I made this project, databases required me to pay and I also had no access to company database, technically I had but I was not able to use it for this mini project.
I made use of a pocket server that I found called USBWebserver as the database for this project.
The zip file contains the app I used as my database. The database is not provided here as the information is confidential. :P
